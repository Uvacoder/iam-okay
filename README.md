This started as a joke. 

A design twitter thread spun out of control when someone dropped "ok, scrapbooker" into a conversation about design systems. 

Some people were pissed. Others thought it was hillarious. I picked up `okscrapbooker.design` through a Porkbun promotion, and set to work. 

This simple site generates A11Y compliant colors at page load, along with a random google font. Built with Gatsby, hosted on Now, and ready to bug the designers in your life.
